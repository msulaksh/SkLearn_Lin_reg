# SkLearn_Lin_reg
Linear Regression using sklearn Python Module, for time series forecasting of the amount.

As part of my learning pathway, after trying Analytics with Twitter data using mongodb Aggregation Pipeline, I'm now set to implement a python library fully focused on Machine Learning, Scikit-Learn.

I'll be using a CSV file, where i'll be using two columns, Date and Amount.

Below is the list of libraries i'll be using:

Pandas, <br>
NumPy, <br>
Scikit Learn, <br>
MatPlotLib. <br>

Below are the import Statements:

import pandas as pd <br>
import numpy as np <br>
from sklearn import linear_model <br>
from sklearn import metrics <br>
from pandas import read_csv <br>
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split <br>
from matplotlib import pyplot <br>
